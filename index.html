              <h1>Charles Chaplin</h1>
              <p>Charles Chaplin, born on April 16, 1889, in London, England, was a legendary actor, filmmaker, and composer who gained worldwide recognition for his iconic character <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tramp">"The Tramp"</a> during the silent film era. Coming from a family of performers, he began his career in music halls before joining Fred Karno's comedy troupe, which led to his break in the American film industry. Signing with the Keystone Film Company in 1913, Chaplin quickly gained popularity, and by 1918, he was a global sensation. Co-founding United Artists in 1919, he directed and starred in numerous critically acclaimed films, such as "The Kid," "The Gold Rush," "City Lights," and "Modern Times." Despite personal controversies and being blacklisted in the United States during the McCarthy era, Chaplin remained a highly influential figure in the world of cinema. He was awarded an honorary Academy Award in 1972 for his immense contribution to the film industry and passed away on December 25, 1977, leaving behind a lasting legacy.</p>
